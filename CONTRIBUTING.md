# Thanks for Getting Involved! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Here is a typical workflow for contributing... if you have _any_ questions, please ask!

1. Decide what you want to work on (if you want to fix an issue, please comment on the issue asking us to assign it to you).
2. [Fork][fork] the repository you want to work on.
3. [Clone][clone] the forked repository locally.
4. [Create a branch][branch].
   - We recommend include into your branch name the issue number you are working on.
   - We also recommend giving your branch a helpful name.
   - A good branch name is `fix-12-build-errors`; a bad one is `fix-stuff`.
5. Make your code changes.
   - This is the really fun part üòÉ.
6. Write tests.
   - Another fun part as you get to write some tests to show off your work üöÄ.
7. Lint and validate code and documents by running `pnpm fix`.
8. Push your changes to your fork.
9. [Create a pull request][pr] from your fork to the original repository.
10. We'll review the updates you made and merge the PR!
